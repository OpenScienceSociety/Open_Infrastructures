# Open_Infrastructures

Opening the scientific process for creating knowledge needs opening the access to a number of diverse resources like scientific instruments, scientific data, digital services, software tools, knowledge and expertise, all needed in some form to conduct research. These elements can be regarded as infrastructural resources that are essential inputs to the research process. Making these resources open and shareable require the adoption of standards, the right legal frameworks and license, and clear rules for access. There is also the crucial aspect of defining the appropriate governance and management mechanisms that ensure their long term maintenance and availability. This presentation tackles commoning as the social practice suitable to create systems to manage these shared resources and provides examples in the area of open science. It also identifies some of the current challenges with particular focus on the digital infrastructures.
